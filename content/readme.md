{{< art >}}


This book is designed so that anyone will find value, however it specifically designed to give marginalized technologists a set of tools in aiding their ability to exploit a fundamentally unbalanced system.

## Think Like A Hacker

This book draws inspiration from my professional history in Linux and Kubernetes security, distributed threat modeling, kernel security, and cloud infrastructure for techniques on modeling and exploiting the system that is the Silicon Valley tech industry. 

If you enjoy linear thinking, modeling complex relationships as systems, and learning about the strategy I developed to become a Senior Principal Engineer in Silicon Valley, this book is for you.

## Understand Exploitation 


Working in tech involves more than just coding. 
This book is the manual that I wish I had in my career that will lay out the culture, economics, expectations, and business philosophies such that anyone can understand.

Learn to exploit the system, before the system exploits you.

## Privilege Escalation 

Lurking at the top of the industry is a group of privileged elite.
Learn how to outperform them, and communicate with them.
Learn how to break into their inner circles of trust.
